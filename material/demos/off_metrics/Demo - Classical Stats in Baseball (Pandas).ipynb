OPS works partly on a justification that OPB and SLG measure two different concepts and you could benefit by combining them.  But why combine them equally?  Why not weight OBP more (as empirical results have suggested)?  Other than that, it's a bit of luck OPS is the thing that works and is close to wOBA rather than some other stat that was concocted and did the same thing."
