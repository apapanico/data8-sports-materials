    "# Expected Points in Football\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo covers building a preliminary Expected Points model for football.  The model provides an expected value of having possession of the ball and 1st and 10 from a particular yard line.  For example, what's the expected next score given a drive starting at our own 42 yard line?  Or starting at our own 1 yard line?  Or opponent 1 yard line?  The interpretation is the expected value of the next score in the game, hence a value of how much the possession is worth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We first define _Possession Value_ was the value of the next score in the game to the possessing team.  For example, if the 49ers hold the ball 1st and 10 at the 42 yardline and the next score in the game occurred 4 drives later (after the 49ers and Raiders traded punts) and it was a field goal by the 49ers, then the _Possession Value_ when they held the ball 1st and 10 at the 42 yardline was +3 points.\n",
