Fans/writers/whoever frequently express an instinctive feel for how NBA games are more pre-determined and that tournaments like the MLB playoffs are more random and luck-based.  One can see aspects of this in how a 73 win team like the Warriors would correspond to about 140 wins in MLB, something no team has ever remotely come close to.  Winning percentages in baseball translated over to the NBA would have NBA teams concentrate in a relatively tight range of about 30-56 wins.  \n",

    "Suppose when the star player is lost, the team is unable to make up the 30ppg production. Say they could only replace the player with someone absolutely worthless on offense but still fine on defense.   Then they'd lose 30 PPG (and thus lose 30 Net PPG on their usual value) and should expect to lose every game in the 10 game stretch.  Why? 30 net points per game is a ludicrous amount and we intuitively know no team can drop 30 net points and still compete in the NBA.  Pythagorean Expectation confirms that: 30 net points on the season corresponds to 1 win.  Over a 10 game stretch the team loses 300 points, which corresponds to about 10 lost wins, ie. 0-10 on the 10 game stretch.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average we should expect losing the star player to lead to fewer wins since we should not expect the team to be able to adequately make up all the lost production.  The 17-18 Warriors had 4 all stars and 3 of them couldn't come very close to making up the production of Steph Curry.

    "\n",
    "The possessions the star player typically uses to take shots and score 30 points aren't disappearing.  Someone else will get to use them.  So someone is going to step into the lineup and help make up for parts of the overall lost production.  For example, when Steph Curry has gone out for rest or injury, Shaun Livingston has often gotten the starting point guard spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the star player is producing 20-30 points per game from his possessions, we may only get 15-20 points per game from the rest of the team that tries to take up the slack.  Thus we might only see a drop of 5-10 points per game overall.  Over the course of 10 games, we may only expect to see 1-3 extra losses than normal."
