    "So far we have studied offensive metrics for baseball.  One thing we have seen is that a lot of metrics are built as linear sums of positive and negative contributions.  We will dissect PER (Player Efficiency Rating) in this lab and observe how it works as a metric for player performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "PER is a comprehensive metric that includes defensive statistics as well as offensive statistics.  While we have so far tried to segregate the two parts of play in baseball, we'll ignore that for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basketball has a lot of moving parts and so the challenge is to figure out what the positive and negative contributions a player can make are and how to value them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on calculating Player Efficiency Rating given Raw NBA Player Data. PER looks like a complex, nasty equation but this notebook will break it down and show how it's not so complicated and how it makes an elegant attempt at performance measurenment.\n",

    "John Hollinger was an NBA columnist for ESPN.com for eight years and is currently the Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Memphis Grizzlies. While at ESPN, he coined many advanced metrics in order to quantify player and team performance, such as Player Efficiency Rating (PER), Offensive Efficiency, Defensive Efficiency and Pace Factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "PER is a rating of a playerâ€™s per-minute statistical performance that Hollinger developed to make player comparisons easier, and has become a widely used standard over the past decade. Hollinger has described PER as the sum of <a href http://www.espn.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=hollinger_john&id=2850240> \"all a player's positive accomplishments, subtracts the negative accomplishments, and returns a per-minute rating of a player's performance.\"</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "As PER attempts to be an all-encompassing number that looks at positive accomplishments, such as field goals, free throws, 3-pointers, assists, rebounds, blocks and steals, and negative results, such as missed shots, turnovers and fouls. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formula adds positive stats and subtracts negative ones through a statistical point value system. The rating for each player is then adjusted to a per-minute basis so that no player is negatively impcted by lack of playing time. It is also adjusted for pace of play. In the end, PER serves as one number that attempts to create an overall player score.\n"

    "> Here, we calculate the number of missed free throws, $FTA - FT$. Next we have a deceitful term of $0.44 + 0.56 \\times DRBP$. Recalling that $DRBP$ is the defensive rebound percentage, we can rewrite this as $0.44 \\cdot ( 1 - DRBP) + DRBP$. The second term is the expected percentage of defensive rebounds on missed free throws that terminate possessions. We multiply by the extra 0.44 to ensure the expected terminated possession. The first term is the expected percentage of free throws that are offensively rebounded. There is an extra 0.44 term. The reason for this is due to the possession continuing for the same offensive team. In this case, if a field goal is attempted, the associated value is absorbed in another term. Hence, the free-throw only contributions are multiplied by a second 0.44 factor. Multiply this term by the league average points per possession and we obtain the expected number of points lost due to missed free throws.\n",

Here's a prompt to get you started: One can argue that the NBA is a league of do everything superstars surrounded by specialists/role players who need to fit into a cog, especially on defense.  How does PER fail to evaluate players outside of the box score-stuffing stars?\n",
